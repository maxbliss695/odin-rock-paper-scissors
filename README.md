# The Odin Project Foundations - Rock Paper Scissors Project

## This serves as version 1 of a game of rock, paper, scissors and will be played via JavaScript prompt (no GUI —— yet).

This project involved a lot of research and learning on my end but I am happy with the outcome and look forward to implementing an actual user interface in later lessons of The Odin Project.

Overall, I enjoyed this first go and it taught me the following:

- How to create external JavaScript files and link them to an HTML document.
- Using an enumerated constant to store the choices globally.
- Creating functions for all required logic.
- Using Math.floor() in conjunction with Math.random() to get a random choice from the computer player.
- Re-prompting a user when a prompt is left empty or an invalid choice is entered.
- Making use of switch statements to handle per round outcomes as well as displaying final results.
- The beginnings of learning about how to use loops to make the game repeat a certain amount of rounds or while re-prompting the user.
